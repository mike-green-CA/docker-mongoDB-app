To start this program simply:
- open a terminal.
- go to the directory of this project.
- enter: docker-compose build

once thats done

- enter: docker-compose up

Once thats stable and the mongo is listening,
and the app has connected to the db you're good to go!

simple open postman or a similar application and try out GET and POST
requsts at http://localhost:3000/tasks

That about wraps that up :)

have fun!
